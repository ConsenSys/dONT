This is a WIP library for generating and distributing personalized decryption keys to verified token holders.
The personalized decryption keys will decrypt a video, but while it does this it will embed a personalized watermark into the video. 




To use:
In main directory type: 

`npm install`  
`stack build`

To test, do
`serverless offline start`

http://localhost:3000/getintarray will show a value retrieved from DynamoDB
http://localhost:3000/getrejected will redirect to same lambda function as above
